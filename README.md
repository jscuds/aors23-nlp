## Setup your Python Environment
To create a python environment with the correct dependencies to run the Jupyter Notebooks in the repository, first ensure that you have `conda` and `pip` installed.  Then, create a new virtual environment for the course called `nlp` and activate it with the following commands:
```
conda create -n nlp
conda activate nlp
```

Using the `requirements.txt` file, run the following command (while the `nlp` environment is activated):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
