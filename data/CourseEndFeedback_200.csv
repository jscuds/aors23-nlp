Mathematical Sciences Question Set Question #298: Describe a particularly HELPFUL classroom experience that you had this semester in this math course.
    !!!12354 In class examples were great for MAJ D and CPT S to use for quizes to see what material was essential to know for WPRs.    
I particularly thought getting up to the boards as soon as MAJ S had a good feeling about our understanding of a concept was helpful. I think MAJ S did a pretty good job at balancing getting us to think to understand concepts and teach it to help us understand.
every time we would go to boards we were encouraged to not work individualy but instead as a group which helped durring dla's and wpr's
humor that motivated learning
"During almost every class period, we got to go up on boards and test our knowledge. I enjoyed boards, because it reinforced what we were learning and showed me where my weaknesses were."
Demonstrations and example problems done by the instructor on the boards were very helpful.
"The use of study sheets during the WPR's forced me to prepare beforehand, and this was very helpful to my success in the class."
Being in groups during in-class assignments
"Not a specific instance, but throughout the semester MAJ Lansford has gone to lengths to ensure the class is learning at pace with the material. I have benefited considerably from his willingness to go over course content again and again until he senses an understanding is met."
Doing practice problems and having in-class examples were very helpful.
Applying math to real life problems
Doing board problems over and over as well as the problem-solving labs before tests really helped me
Doing board work was always helpful since then my classmates and teacher could see where I was messing up and could help.
One helpful experience was doing board problems
The project forced us to work together and think critically. It gave me a better idea of who I could go to for help.
The board problems.
Working board problems is an extremely helpful part of this course. I learn a lot from both my professor and my fellow students.
The notes really saved me throughout the course. MAJ Q really worked hard to help the class understand the material.
I really enjoyed the hands-on applications that we did as a class. Being able to go outside and do different activities that applied to what we were learning was fun and educational.
Something helpful to me was the time we spent at the boards walking through problems
The approach the class took towards breaking down math problems of different orders to solve them helped me when approaching other classes assignments and math problems later on in the course.
Going to the chalkboards to present topics
My teacher kept the class interesting and enjoyable even though I didn't necessarily understand the material.
the mathematica codes provided on the course guide was extremely helpful
Maj R went through a step-by-step procedures for R-Studio that helped set the foundation for the course project. Along with the Course Guide
I really like the board exercises because they accurately show the teacher what a student understands and does not understand.
Any type of board work or practice problems in class was very beneficial
My peers
The tech labs introduced Mathematica to me and helped exercise my coding skills.
Taking board (which was done very rarely)
I think that the worksheets passed out on select lessons were helpful as well as the board problems following web assigns.
Working on the group project
I liked how my instructor was very open to questions and AI.
"Instructor was extremely helpful and willing to challenge students, while following up with effective analysis."
Kahoot and Board Time
"When we go over problems and then practice them on boards in class, it really cements the information."
Review problems before WPRs.
Hitting the boards after learning the material to do the problems in groups allows for a personal pace to be set but also to gain other perspectives on a problem.
"Every day we would go up to the boards and practice problems, which I thought was much more helpful than listening to a lecture."
The Math Modeling Application Days were very helpful in proving the practical applications of our lessons by inputting them into real-world scenarios.
Kahoots
Going through the R code necessary for our project in class was helpful.
The instructor really helped us through the project.
Performing Statistical Investigation Labs where we went through the full statistical process was helpful in cementing that process as it was the foundation for the entire course.
upon seeing the entire class had failed a quiz MAJ Kiser negated the quiz and used it as a learning opportunity.
The group projects helped me prepare for the WPRs and DLAs.
When we were shown how to solve problems correctly in class
A helpful experience was when my instructor returned after taking a couple days off because of the birth of his child and took the time to thoroughly explain what the substitutes taught us because a majority of the class was lost.
"Whenever we come to class and did team work, it was very helpful. We had these experiences everyday."
"Doing individual board work. This allowed us the chance to do the work on our feet (literally and figuratively), and get our work corrected by our instructor."
Play books
"The math project, I learned a lot about modeling and real world solutions."
"I enjoyed when we would get called up to solve a problem and if we did not know how to solve it, other students would help us out. This was beneficial because it allowed us to get reps and stay engaged in class, especially on days when it was hard to stay engaged."
"Webassign, Excel, Mathematica"
"I lke the board work that we did in every class, it helped me get a better understanding of the material that we were covering for that days lesson."
The real-world examples of using statistics to resolve problems had the greatest benefit for me. Especially the lesson where we read and analyzed the trial where statistics was used to prove the innocence or guilt of the suspected murderer.
Working with teams on DLAs and team portions of WPRs was very helpful in achieving a high grade in the course.
Our board problems with groups and individually facilitated learning.
"I was skeptical about working board problems in the beginning, but I quickly realized how much more helpful it was than simply working the problem in my notes as board work promoted working with my peers which not only helped me understand the problem better, but also created an environment in which I was much more comfortable asking my peers for assistance when needed and vice versa."
My instructor would often use real world examples in class
Getting the chance to work with our classmates on the boards and then ask MAJ Z if we had any questions was helpful.
"Dr. L encouraged me to research linear algebra applications of quantum physics, which is my chosen area of study."
Completing board work in groups allowed me to learn from both my peers and instructor when trying to grasp the idea of matrices and social networks.
The 'take boards' exercises.
Use of the boards to take notes and do example problems.
The instructor was able to manage the scope of the course and its objectives. He was able to relate it to his life and mentor us all personally to ensure we are recieving the material.
Visualizing the heat and wave equations
Being in groups that we had to work together to get a good grade and do classwork with.
I liked how we drew on boards because it helped me solve the lessons in class rather than just look at them and hope I remember in the future.
"I liked coding in class, because that is what I struggled with the most."
A helpful classroom experience I had was using roulette to comprehend probabilities  and Markov chains
Working through the lake front house data set in class was very helpful for me.
"board work with deskmates, competing for extra credit"
Kahoot in classroom for review.

I had a sudden realization on how to work with a concept as Captain W explained it to me while we were doing boardwork.

Group work at the boards
The use of the white board for writing notes was effective. To section the board off into two sections and allow students to keep up was helpful.
"LTC V made us do a lot of board work every day to practice problems, which helped me a lot. She would then come by each students board and help correct them if needed."
CPT L was very positive and engaging. He made the difference in the course

The course project provided a unique and helpful opportunity to implement material learned in class and experiment with new tools.
"Taking boards is always the best way to learn, I believe. 
"
Working with my table on in class exercises.
Doing lots of work on boards taught me how to do problems
"Being in the classroom and performing the very interactive problems such as the Halloween and MA103 Tree challenge were very great. Overall, any in-class activity really helped me in understanding the content."
I learned a lot since I was the only person who ever talked in class or asked any questions.
I really liked when LTC E drew pictures on the board to help us understand the topics conceptually.
A helpful class experience I had was going to the board after learning the material to try and work out a problem with my small group of peers.  This allowed us to determine how well we grasped the topic and if we had to spend more time practicing this for future exams.
When my pod mates showed up prepared for the WPR Group portion
My instructor had me go up in front of class and attempt to present some R-code I had written to answer a class question. From here I was able to get constructive feed back from both him ad the class of where I had messed up in my code.
Helpful experiences include the worksheets given in class with the practice problems. Going to boards and discussing with classmates was also helpful.
"I really appreciated when Dr. N would walk us through the various theorems in the book. Those theorems can be difficult to read on your own, and she did a really good job teaching us how to read them and walking us through each portion of them."
Review days befroe the WPRs helped when it came to reviewing in class with the instructor
I was able to work together with my group members to get a correct answer.
the final project

"Doing problems on the blackboard specifically helped because if I didn't understand something, the chances of someone in my group knowing were high so I had them explain it to me."
Boards
Trying to show real world application of math
"Any time CPT B would go over our readings or run though the processes we studied the night before really helped to cement the concept and course material into my head. I found that the most important source in the class was the teacher, and the Modeling in a Real and Complex World text book."
Everytime working on the boards with my group members was very beneficial to me and my learning.

COL W could tell after a particularly challenging class that I was not understanding the material and encouraged me to do AI.
MAJ Q held AI in which we could ask any questions we needed answers to.
Working with groups.
Daily assessments allowed for class to make sure we understood every step.
The scavenger hunts and exercises helped my group bond.
We had multiple people who understood the proofs in class and we would discuss them.
"Whenever I go in for AI, I understand the topic more."
The board sheets that were given for each class helped me have an organized set of example problems.
Working through the problems with the whole class and discussing different methods
I really enjoyed having a fun class as it made class more engaging and fun. Also I liked his teaching methods.

Working in R an learning how to code in it
"I would say when MAJ V repeats the previous lesson at the beginning of every class, I think this is really helpful to remind us what we have learned and how it relates to today's lesson."
I think conducting in class statistical analysis labs with R was very helpful in understanding the different concepts for the course. I think those activities are what helped me the most.
Having the teacher be able to look back on past experiences and then make them into examples helped.

"One time we broke apart into two groups with learning matrices so that people could get extra help or people could work ahead, which I found was a good use of my time in class to not have to go over things I already had a good handle on."
The flowcharts that MAJ M showed and the course guide
The constant use of black boards to complete in class questions.
Work with partners
Video AI.
Doing part of the Tech Labs in class helped a lot to start the Tech Labs later.
A teacher who helped facilitate critical thinking.
Working in groups on practice problems and other in class assignments.
I really liked the coding on Python - it definitely made me think more critically and I was always really excited to tackle the problem.
"The group portions of the DLAs were particularly challenging as I have never had to work on a test as a group before. Not only did it draw on time management, but also people management as you try to allocate different problems to different people in your group."
"In the classroom, going over lessons on the board and doing practice problems helped greatly to understand the concepts behind the tasks we were doing."
CPT H emphasized real-world applications to our lessons. This helped me critically think about issues in the world and Army. Another helpful aspect to the class was CPT H's power point animations. It helped me visualize our lessons worked.

I enjoyed the amount of board work we would do in class.
I liked how every once in a while we would go to boards and work out problems as a class.
I believe that working in teams was a very important part in this math class. It allowed for the students to build a better understanding of the material and work with peers who may have a different perspective on problem solving.
"Treating cadets as adults by giving all required sources and detailed solutions, but not mandating them to do for example web assign every day."
"My classmates always helped me understand topics when I did not understand the information provided by the instructor. When information was confusing, my desk mates helped to clear up any confusion."
COL B was very good at guiding us through difficult concepts without doing the thinking for us.
We were assigned mentors for our projects who helped greatly. I learned more from my mentor than I was able to understand in class because of the one-on-one help.
MAJ U was extremely helpful one thing that particularly helped was his unique way of making people participate in class. He used flashcards and randomly called on Cadets which made everyone pat attention to class and participate.
A helpful classroom experience that I had this semester was when we all were actively engaged in the conversation and people were asking very helpful questions before the WPR.
Dr. C was really good at showing us how to solve problems and offering the proof.
"I learned to use given data, create a model based on that and check how good that model is."
small class size allowed for me to ask a lot of questions
Group work on math modeling days
When we went through the math/theoretical concepts of neural networks before coding one.
Being able to see these problems in real world applications.

"Creating the charts in notes and on the boards, all of the notes he took on the board were super helpful to look back on when studying"

Using a data set that cadets can relate to (the Facebook one) to stimulate thinking.
"LTC E was very good about challenging us while still giving us help as needed, at least after the first problem set. He was very understanding towards our level of knowledge. He had us code a lot, but was always willing to look at our code or work on it in class. Also really love the life stories."

The experience of working in groups was one that I learned a lot from
"The Excel we worked with was helpful and very interesting and relevant to the material. Even though the projects we did took a long time, I thought they supplemented the course well. I also had not done math projects in the past. It was strictly learning the material, test, and then the next topic."
Working with groupmates everyday to help teamwork skills as well as mathematical skills
The Board work was very helpful in solidifying topics we had just covered.
The board questions and examples provided in the textbook was very good at walking you step by step through the concepts and applying them. This helped me prepare for the Midterm and homework questions.

Taking boards and working out the different laplace transforms in small groups helped a lot.
MAJ O used a lot of real world examples to go hand in hand with his lessons.  This made the lessons easier to understand when learning difficult topics.
One helpful experience was working through trigonometric and power functions in excel together as a class.
Working in groups at the boards
"When we had a quiz where we told simple instructions in the execution of it and Dr. K walked out and we all had to deliberately work together to work the quiz. That engaged my attention and comprehension of the work, I retained that information well."
"Dr. A has been particularly helpful in my Linear Algebra nightmare. I chose this course because I thought it would be easy, and manageable. (On recommendation from a firstie). In hindsight I should have been more prepared to commit time to this class."
When I received help from a student in my new group on the night before's homework.
Going over example problems the few times we actually could finish them.
Doing partner board problems and relying on others in the course for learning when I was struggling with a concept.

"A helpful class experience was the end of block days where we reviewed as a class, and then presented parts of the block in groups. By the end of the class, I had a broad review of all class concepts"
Going through Python code in class together.
Board work when going through webassign problems
In-depth discussion of difficult material in class until everyone understood.
Our seats were sometimes scrambled so we could see chance in practice.
The teachers understanding of the math really helped to truly understand more of the harder topics in the course
"We worked in groups most of the time, and that really helped me a lot."
Having LTC Y as a teacher was honestly the most helpful experience in 103. She has been awesome as a teacher and an even better person.
The PSL's we did with the tank type think helped me better grasp the concept in a real way.

Getting to peer-edit the final project write ups in class was extremely helpful in terms of the course project.
Board problems and when the teacher walked through the board problems
Boardwork
Having in class AI was helpful. The day before WPRs when we have access to the teacher during the problem solving lab and the day before the course project was due having time to peer review and ask questions in class was valuable.
A helpful situation was through the use of the PSL. All PSLs were able to take the blocks information and apply it to a complex problem or problems that in turn helped me really understand the material.
doing the math prject
The board problems that we did at the end of each lesson helped me really gain a good understanding of the material and how to use R-Studio
Our instructor stayed after class and let myself and another student run through a problem that significantly helped me on that topic.
"Doing practice problems that are similar to the ones on the WPRs. Normally, in class, the questions are significantly easier than the WPR. So when we do an advance question it helps more on the WPRs."

The final math modeling day in this class used a lot of our skills in an advanced way but I still had a firm grasp on the material
He used the Tower of Hanoi to help us learn about probability.
Whenever he actually went into detail over the confusing material instead of just assuming we understood like other teachers
"I really enjoyed the board activities that we did, I think that was the experience within class that benefitted my learning. It offered a chance for us to practice the material, collaborate with others, and have the teacher assist if needed."
"CPT H would always walk around and check our boards while we did board work, if we weren't understanding something he would carefully explain it to us until we did."
"Something that was helpful in this class was reviewing the lesson in class, then applying the concepts to R studio with the corresponding code. This allowed me to learn what I was doing and how to do it more efficiently."
The instructor was very engaging when it came to explaining the day's material.
Our IPR meeting was helpful in developing our project.
during our projects and problem solving lab the instructor helped out a lot
N/A
Using R studio everyday
Going over board problems in class
N/A
Doing real world problems associated with each lesson. It really helped my understanding of how to actually apply the concepts we learned instead of just memorizing steps and functions.

"The AI before class, after class, and out of class was extremely helpful. He took time to discuss not only class related subjects, but stimulated questions about the Army, as well. Even if he may not seem like he cares, you can tell he does. The extra comments and life personal touches in class are humorous. Please keep those. It helps cadets to learn the standard and strive to be better. It may take time, but these cadets will be able to reflect upon this time in the future and better themselves, hopefully."
"Dr. M started to do boardwork in the middle of the semester, and that helped a lot."
The handouts given in class generally helped me to understand the content.
I really enjoyed the group portions of the assesments.


Practicing by incorporating a game in the daily exercises.
The constant going to the boards and forcing us to do labs in order to practice the coding and concepts that we were given in class were very helpful tools in my development throughout the course.
working on the group project
"Working with my second pod group. CDT W and CDT K were extremely helpful, I learned a lot from the two of them."
the course project; helped apply in-class learning to the real world which helped to drive home the concepts we were learning
"Our teacher always had relevant, real-world problems so we had a sense of how we could actually apply the math we learn in real life. CPT B is a great teacher and his efforts to prepare for his class is obvious. I hope more teachers had his work ethic and desire to actually teach students."
I got a lot of helpful practice from doing board problems with a partner.
"MAJ R called me up to the board once and had me demonstrate my knowledge to the class, this required me to think on the spot and reinforced confidence in my ability for that particular lesson."
Dr. C is always willing to answer questions one on one after class.
Always working at the boards in groups
The kaleidoscope DLA.
In the beginning of the semester we had a lot of group work where we could interact and ask questions from my instructor.
LTC K was extremely effective in utilizing the use of extremely useful handouts and notesheets which helped me tremendously in studying
taking boards
CPT R
Amount of reference sheets and stuff we are allowed on the WPR's.
I thought that the problem solving labs were helpful because they helped increase my understanding of course material both for myself and for the WPRs.
"Working together in groups everyday in class, using the boards to do our work"
Doing board problems
The instructors use of well thought out lesson plans.
Taking board individually for in class problems
Having FCE help with peers in class
Group project.
The final project with a partner.
I think that when we did break down into groups and work together it was helpful.
I would say using board work and group work helped my classroom experience in the math course.
We were assigned different partners for labs
When the LTC was in the classroom we had a great learning day.
The note sheets for graded assignments were very useful.
Working through board problems helped me to understand the concepts we went over in class.
Using your tablet to write all the notes and going through specific problems in class especially towards the end of the course really helped when I went back to study because I study best by going through examples.
Very open to answering difficult questions
