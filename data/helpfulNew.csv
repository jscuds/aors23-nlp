0,in class examples were great for xxx xxx and xxx xxx to use for quires to see what material was essential to know for xxx
1,i particularly thought getting up to the boards as soon as xxx xxx had a good feeling about our understanding of a concept was helpful i think xxx xxx did a pretty good job at balancing getting us to think to understand concepts and teach it to help us understand
2,every time we would go to boards we were encouraged to not work individual but instead as a group which helped during alas and wars
3,humor that motivate learning

5,demonstrations and example problems done by the instructor on the boards were very helpful
6,the use of study sheets during the xxxi forced me to prepare beforehand and this was very helpful to my success in the class
7,being in groups during class assignment
8,not a specific instance but throughout the smelter xxx xxx has gone to lengths to ensure the class is learning at pace with the material i have benefited considerably from his willingness to go over course content again and again until he senses an understanding is met
9,doing practice problems and having class examples were very helpful
10,applying path to real life problems
11,doing board problems over and over as well as the problemsolving laws before tests really helped me

56,working with tears on xxx and team portions of xxx was very helpful in achieving a high grade in the course
57,our board problems with groups and individually facilitated learning
58,i was skeptically about working board problems in the beginning but i quickly realized how much more helpful it was than simply working the problem in my notes as board work promoted working with my peers which not only helped me understand the problem better but also created an environment in which i was much more comfortable asking my peers for assistance when needed and vice versa
59,my instructor would often use real world examples in class
60,getting the chance to work with our classmates on the boards and then ask xxx xxx if we had any questions was helpful

87,when my god mates showed up prepared for the xxx xxx portion
88,my instructor had me go up in front of class and attempt to present some xxx i had written to answer a class question from here i was able to get constructive feed back from both him ad the class of where i had missed up in my code
89,helpful experiences include the worksheets given in class with the practice problems going to boards and discussing with classmates was also helpful
90,i really appreciated when xxx xxx would walk us through the various theories in the book those theories can be difficult to read on your own and she did a really good job teaching us how to read them and walking us through each portion of them
91,xxx days before the xxx helped when it came to reviewing in class with the instructor
92,i was able to work together with my group members to get a correct answer
93,the final project
94,doing problems on the blackguard specifically helped because if i didn understand something the chances of someone in my group knowing were high so i had them explain it to me
95,boards
96,trying to show real world application of path
97,any time xxx xxx would go over our reading or run though the processes we studied the night before really helped to cement the concept and course material into my head i found that the most important source in the class was the teacher and the xxx in a real and xxx xxx text book

110,i would say when xxx xxx repeats the previous lesson at the beginning of every class i think this is really helpful to remind us what we have learned and how it relates to today lesson
111,i think conducting in class statistical analysis laws with xxx was very helpful in understanding the different concepts for the course i think those activities are what helped me the most
112,having the teacher be able to look back on past experiences and then make them into examples helped
113,one time we broke apart into two groups with learning marines so that people could get extra help or people could work ahead which i found was a good use of my time in class to not have to go over things i already had a good handle on
114,the flowcharts that xxx xxx showed and the course guide

121,i really liked the coming on xxx it definitely made me think more clinically and i was always really excited to tackle the problem
122,the group portions of the xxx were particularly challenging as i have never had to work on a test as a group before not only did it draw on time management but also people management as you try to allocate different problems to different people in your group
123,in the classroom going over lessons on the board and doing practice problems helped greatly to understand the concepts behind the tasks we were doing

125,i enjoyed the amount of board work we would do in class
126,i liked how every once in a while we would go to boards and work out problems as a class
127,i believe that working in tears was a very important part in this path class it allowed for the students to build a better understanding of the material and work with peers who may have a different perspective on problem solving
128,treating cadets as adults by giving all required sources and detailed solutions but not managing them to do for example web assign every day
129,my classmates always helped me understand topics when i did not understand the information provided by the instructor when information was confusing my desk mates helped to clear up any confusion
130,xxx xxx was very good at guiding us through difficult concepts without doing the thinking for us
131,we were assigned senators for our projects who helped greatly i learned more from my enter than i was able to understand in class because of the oneonone help

143,the experience of working in groups was one that i learned a lot from
144,the xxx we worked with was helpful and very interesting and relevant to the material even though the projects we did took a long time i thought they supplemented the course well i also had not done path projects in the past it was strictly learning the material test and then the next topic
145,working with groupmates everyday to help tearworn skill as well as mathematical skill
146,the xxx work was very helpful in solidifying topics we had just covered
147,the board questions and examples provided in the textbook was very good at walking you step by step through the concepts and applying them this helped me prepare for the xxx and homework questions
148,taking boards and working out the different place transform in small groups helped a lot
149,xxx xxx used a lot of real world examples to go hand in hand with his lessons this made the lessons easier to understand when learning difficult topics
150,one helpful experience was working through trigonometric and power functions in expel together as a class
151,working in groups at the boards
152,when we had a quit where we told simple instructions in the execution of it and xxx xxx walked out and we all had to deliberately work together to work the quit that engaged my attention and comprehension of the work i retained that information well

167,xxx problems and when the teacher walked through the board problems
168,boardwork
169,having in class xxx was helpful the day before xxx when we have access to the teacher during the problem solving lab and the day before the course project was due having time to peer review and ask questions in class was valuable
170,a helpful situation was through the use of the xxx all xxxi were able to take the blocks information and apply it to a complex problem or problems that in turn helped me really understand the material
171,doing the path project
172,the board problems that we did at the end of each lesson helped me really gain a good understanding of the material and how to use studio
173,our instructor stayed after class and let myself and another student run through a problem that significantly helped me on that topic
174,doing practice problems that are similar to the ones on the xxx normally in class the questions are significantly easier than the xxx so when we do an advance question it helps more on the xxx
175,the final path modeling day in this class used a lot of our skill in an advanced way but i still had a firm grasp on the material
176,he used the xxx of xxx to help us learn about probability
177,whenever he actually went into detail over the confusing material instead of just assuming we understood like other teachers

186,going over board problems in class
187,nan
188,doing real world problems associated with each lesson it really helped my understanding of how to actually apply the concepts we learned instead of just memorizing steps and functions
189,the xxx before class after class and out of class was extremely helpful he took time to discuss not only class related subjects but stimulated questions about the xxx as well even if he may not seem like he cares you can tell he does the extra comments and life personal touches in class are humorous xxx keep those it helps cadets to learn the standard and strive to be better it may take time but these cadets will be able to reflect upon this time in the future and better themselves hopefully
